When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository is ideal when making changes from another computer or when 
    collaborating or conributing to a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is good to have to push and pull manually in case you are not ready to share your
    changes publically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of repositories made directly to your own GitHub account. Clones are copies of repositories made to your computer with a origin remote automatically setup for it. Branches are simply different versions of the repository and are used to push and pull from GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is beneficial to have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally
    because then it can be accessed without an internet connection and does not need to be merged immediately.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'm not sure how collaboration would take place without Git or GitHub. It would probably be more complicated and time-consuming.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It will be convenient to make changes in a seperate branch when collaborating with other people, in order to agree with changes before altering the master branch.
